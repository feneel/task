# Frontend Test Task

This project is an implementation of the provided landing page mock using **HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and a little JavaScript**. The goal of the assignment was to reproduce the layout and behavior shown in the reference image/PSD, focusing on structure and positioning rather than pixel-perfect visuals.

## How to Run

1. Download the project files (HTML file, optional `index.css`, and the placeholder images).
2. Open the HTML file directly in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - No server is strictly required.
3. Make sure you’re online — Bootstrap CSS and JS are loaded via CDN.

That’s it.
